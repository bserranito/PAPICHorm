Data for **Uncovering Changes in Ormer (Haliotis tuberculata) Local Populations through Participatory Science Monitoring**

This repository contains the datasets used in the study Uncovering changes in Ormer (Haliotis tuberculata) local populations through participatory science monitoring.

Sheet Descriptions

- **Velella_data**
Contains contemporary monitoring data, including:

Survey ID (linked to date)
Sampling coordinates
Water height relative to tide
Depth recorded by dive computer
Size (cm) of each individual observed

-**Historical_data_size**
Provides size and abundance data for ormers collected during monitoring in the late 1980s. Values were digitized from figures published in Clavier & Chardy (1989).

-**Historical_data_dens**
Reports density data (individuals per 10 m²) as published by Clavier (1987) and Clavier & Chardy (1989).

-**Historical_data_coordinates**
Contains estimated coordinates for sites 1, 2, and 3, derived from a repeated (n=10) digitalization process.
